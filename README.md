# blog-chapter1
This is the blog project built in the first chapter of the book "Django by example" by "Antonio Mel√©".
In this chapter we learn how to create a basic model for a Post of a blog app. We learn the basics of templates and routing our URLs with our Function based views
and we also get to grasp on what are Class based views and how to use them.
We learn how to set up the Django admin panel and how to use filters and customize the display of the items.
We learned how to use the "get_object_or_404" which is basically a shortcut to try: / except: and also how to define the get_absolute_url() method in our Model class in models.py
to get the URL of a single item using arguments that we choose to use (see Post model in blog.models.py)
We saw how to iterate through all of the items in the HTML template and how to use a paginator, defined in the views.py
